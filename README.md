# SeleniumDemoFramework
For test automation, I have developed a straightforward Selenium Sample Framework. where our test cases can be written simply from Excel sheets.
Two classes are available. Class for Drivers and Functions.
The preset methods such as click and sendkeys functions are contained in the functions class.
Driver classes include setup, such as connections to webdrivers and excel sheets.
Now, without opening the IDE, we can write and execute all of the test cases and locators directly from the excel sheet.
